# Assignment #8 - Babbage's Cabbage's

## The Program

You have been hired to design and implement a database-driven solution written in Oracle PL/SQL that can compute an employee's weekly gross pay, taxes, and net pay. The inputs to the program will come from a database table, where each row includes an employee's first and last names, number of hours worked, and hourly rate of pay. Outputs will be written to a second table, including gross pay, taxes, transportation fee and net pay amounts.
